# About

The Windy City Brass Society is a collection of some of the top competitive brass and percussion musicians in Chicago dedicated to creating an enriching and fruitful education experience for youth brass musicians throughout the Chicagoland area. Through our Academy program, led by some of the top minds in competitive brass music, we seek to educate brass musicians from music education programs in the brass band medium, challenging them and providing them with the tools to grow into strong, thoughtful musicians with a passion for creating wonderful music.
