# About

The Windy City Brass Society is a collection of some of the leading brass and percussion musicians in Chicago, dedicated to creating an enriching and fruitful education experience for youth brass and percussion musicians throughout the Chicagoland area. Through our Academy program, led by some of the top minds in competitive brass music, we seek to educate brass and percussion musicians from all communities in the brass band medium, challenging them and providing them with the tools to grow into strong, thoughtful musicians with a passion for creating wonderful music.

# Event Highlights
## Windy City Brass Academy
Brass and percussion musicians in grades 8-12 are invited to participate in an all-day event where they will meet in section master classes and rehearse in a full brass band setting.

## Performance
The day will culminate in a concert at 7pm, when participants will have the opportunity to play alongside some of the finest brass band musicians in the area! 

## Outstanding Instruction
Participants will benefit from instruction by leading performers and educators from the Chicagoland area.

# When and Where

The Windy City Brass Academy's second session will take place on January 4, 2025, at the College of DuPage - 425 Fawell Blvd, Glen Ellyn, IL 60137.
